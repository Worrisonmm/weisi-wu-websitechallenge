# Web App Project Implementation

> See: [The Web App Project](project.md)

## Learning Objectives

  1. Create a tool to address user needs and solve a business problem.
  2. Practice investigating and leveraging third-party services and Node.js packages to speed development and enhance capabilities.

## Instructions

### Dev Process Requirements

Iteratively develop your project using version control practices. Save new versions of your source code as you reach key milestones.

If working in a group, each group member should strive to make significant contributions to the application's source code!

## Submission Instructions

Submit the designated Google Form before the designated date, providing the URLs to your GitHub repository and hosted site.




## Evaluation

Web applications will be evaluated according to the requirements set forth above, as summarized by the rubric below:

Category | Requirement | Weight
--- | --- | ---
Hosting | Website is publicly accessible on the Internet (i.e. hosted via GitHub Pages or Heroku). | 20%
Structure | Website has at least three navigable pages, with consistent navigation across all pages. | 10%
Style | Website is reasonably well styled, and "responsive" when window is resized to a mobile device width. | 10%
Interactivity | ... | X%
Data Processing | ... | X%
Content | Website content is creative and unique. | 10%
Documentation | Contains a comprehensive README file with written setup instructions and usage commands. | 20%
Security | Excludes sensitive information and credentials from version control; protects secret credentials and/or user data as necessary. | 10%
Dev Process | Submitted via remote Git repository which reflects an incremental revision history, and contributions from all team members. | 20%









This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.

If experiencing navigation or functionality error(s) while evaluating the website, evaluators are advised to reduce the grade by between 4% and 25%, depending on the circumstances and severity of the error(s).

In recognition of deliverables which exhibit functionality above and beyond the basic requirements, evaluators are encouraged to award between 4% and 15% "engagement points" to be applied as extra credit.
