# Local Node.js Development Environment Setup

## Objectives

This document helps you install and configure the tools you'll need to develop Node.js applications on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

You should already have:

  + a GitHub Account
  + a Text Editor (e.g. VS Code) installed locally

## Command-line Application

Mac users who don't already have a preferred command-line application are encouraged to use the built-in Terminal application (no need to download anything).

Windows users who don't already have a preferred command-line application are encouraged to install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which will allow Windows users to write the same unix-style commands as Mac users.

> FYI: The ["Command-line Computing" Exercise](/exercises/command-line-computing/exercise.md) will introduce you to the most useful commands for Mac Terminal and Windows Git Bash.

## Git CLI

Windows users who have installed Git Bash (see "Command-line Application" section above) will have satisfied the Git CLI installation requirement.

Mac users may find that Git is already installed, otherwise you are encouraged to install Git via Homebrew. See the professor's [Git installation reference](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/notes/clis/git.md#installation) for more details.


After installing the Git CLI, all students (Mac and Windows) should [configure SSH Keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) and associate them with their GitHub Account.


## Node.js

Follow the steps in the [Node.js Overview](/notes/javascript/node.md) to install Node.js and NPM, either from the official website, or using a version manager like NVM or NVM-Windows.
